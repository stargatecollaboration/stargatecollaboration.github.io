# How to contribute to this stargate collaboration website repo

Contributions are welcome from any member of the collaboration.
To do so, follow these steps.

1. Fork this repository from the github website.
2. From a terminal, `git clone` your fork of the repo
2. Create a feature branch to add or modify content (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`).  You should aim to do one branch (and therefore one Pull Request) per feature or change, as that will make review faster and easier. 
3. Make your change to the files in your branch.
4. Commit your change (`git add path/to/my/notebook/notebook.ipynb`;  `git commit -m 'Added some feature'`), as many times as necessary to capture your development history.
5. Push to your github fork's branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
6. Create a new Pull Request from your fork into `stargatecollaboration.github.io` using the GitHub web site. From your fork's web page a message appears asking if you would like to turn the recent commit into a pull request. Be sure to include a description that describes what you changed when submitting the pull request.

Once you've created a Pull Request, the administrators will review your changes and then merge to the master branch if they are acceptable.
